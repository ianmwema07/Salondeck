## Description
Currently, there is a lot of time being wasted on the salon due to waiting or long lines, especially on weekends. There are many services in the salons including kinky hair hairdressing, pedicures, manicures, body massage, and eyebrow treatments. Therefore the “SalonDeck” salon appointment application aims at  saving the time wasted by booking an early appointment and letting the salon know your choice of hairstyle or any other service of your choice for early preparation. This will be done by the “SalonDeck”  salon appointment application that enables one to book an appointment and choose the preferred date and time.
